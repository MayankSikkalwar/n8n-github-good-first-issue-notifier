GitHub "Good First Issue" Notifier
An automated workflow built with n8n.io that monitors specified GitHub repositories for beginner-friendly open-source contribution opportunities and sends real-time notifications to a Telegram channel.

üéØ Problem Solved
For developers looking to start contributing to open-source, finding the right first issue can be a challenge. Manually checking dozens of repositories for issues labeled "good first issue" is time-consuming and inefficient. This project automates the entire discovery process, creating a streamlined, real-time feed of accessible contribution opportunities.

üîß How It Works
The workflow runs on a regular schedule and executes the following steps:

Schedule Trigger: A CRON-based trigger fires the workflow at a set interval (e.g., every hour) to check for new issues.

Fetch Repository Issues: The workflow connects to the GitHub API to retrieve a list of all open issues from one or more target repositories.

Filter for "Good First Issues": It then loops through each issue, parsing the JSON data to identify and filter for only those that contain the "good first issue" label.

Format Notification: The relevant details for each matching issue (such as Title, Repository Name, and URL) are extracted and formatted into a clean, readable message using the "Edit Fields" node.

Send Telegram Alert: Finally, the formatted message is sent to a dedicated Telegram channel via the Telegram Bot API, immediately notifying subscribers of the new opportunity.
